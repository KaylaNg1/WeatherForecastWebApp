# Design
Almost the entirety of the UI design was self-created, including the forecast icons which were hand drawn. Exceptions include the background which was created by PITAN, the geolocation icon from PNGWing as well as the text-font which utilized Google's Exo 2 Font from their [Google Fonts API](https://developers.google.com/fonts)
