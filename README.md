# Weather Forecast Web App
Web application that implements the Forecast Weather API from [WeatherApi.com](WeatherAPI.com). Users are able to input any city of their choosing into the search bar and are given the current temperature, forecast, humidity, and more along with the local time/date of the input.

# Design Goal
In the initialy planning stages, I had wanted to design a simplistic but aesthetic web application that would allow me to integrate web development, which I have prior experience in, with APIs. I have never used APIs before so as a learning curve, I wanted to pursue a project that wouldn't be too complex but would still give me the hands-on experience I seeked.

Below is a sketch I created for the base design of my web application.

# Design
Almost the entirety of the UI design was self-created, including the forecast icons which were hand drawn. Exceptions include the background which was created by PITAN, the geolocation icon from PNGWing as well as the text-font which utilized Google's Exo 2 Font from their [Google Fonts API](https://developers.google.com/fonts)
